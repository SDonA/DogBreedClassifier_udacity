## Project Overview<a name="motivation"></a>

Computer vision is one of the major technological advances today - sitting at the the heart of processes/activities in various industries such as the automobile, medicine, security, communication, etc. In this project a Dog Breed classification system is developed using Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Having experienced very close family members and friends suffer from cardiovascular related illnesses with occasional worrisome attacks, I was inspired to understand what is critical for patients who survived or died from heart attacks/failures. [Using In Hospital Mortality dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/saurabhshahane/in-hospital-mortality-prediction), I was particularly interested in 

1. What are the top 3 prevalent comorbidities in HF patients and the risk level with age?
2. What are the major inter-relationships between the vital signs related to HF?
3. What are the major inter-relationships between the comorbidities related to HF?
4. What are the top 5 predictive features of mortality in HF patients?
